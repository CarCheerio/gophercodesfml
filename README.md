# CSCE 201 Project

This repo is for our Computer Programming 1 project for UAA's CSCE A201 class.

People who committed to this project are:

- Carson Hastie
- Mari Mejia-Honea
- Daniel Ribuffo

## Project Description

This project is a small game that works like a cross between whack-a-mole and battleship. 
The user is challenged with attempting to find a gopher on the map and bopping them on the head with a hammer. The user may instead opt to place stakes into the ground so that they can trap/coerce the gopher to move in a specific direction to the user's advantage. The game is set to be played on a 10 x 10 space, with 1 row and column of fencing surrounding the playing field.

## Workflow breakdown:
#### MVP:
- Stake Logic: Daniel [link to replit](https://replit.com/join/xyoziueujn-danielribuffo)
- Hammer Logic: Mari
- 2D Array, Gopher logic: Mari [link to replit](https://replit.com/@samejiahonea/Project1)
- GUI: Carson
- Pixel Art: Maru
- Backend Integration: Daniel
- Documentation: Daniel

#### Stretch Goals:
- Turn Counter
- Score based on that turn counter: (amount of actions take) ^-1 to the number of points.
- Sound cue for moving the gopher
- Sound cue when striking the gopher
- Levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)

## How To's
This game takes no special dependencies to run. If you wish to edit any of the games' code we used Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) so you will need to download the correct SDK from their website. The languaged we used was C++ and we used the Visual Studio IDE.

To run the game, simply download the .exe (when available) and run it.
